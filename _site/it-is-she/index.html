    <p>_ It is she!</p>

<p>The step step step coming from the hallway was unmistakable. After 3 long
months, they would be together again.</p>

<p>He had not digested well the long time they had spent away from each other.
There was nothing suspicious on the day she departed. They followed the same
daily routine. The awakening coffee smell and the bright light coming from the
still half closed window were foretokening another sunny day. From the bed, he
was sure it would just be another lazy day together while waiting for the
sluggish forty minutes of hair drying and its grating noise to come to an end.</p>

<p>They would have the entire house only for them, she would let the hours go
without caring about changing her pajamas. He would absorb each loving gesture
and the love coming from her eyes. He surely loved those lazy days and the
routine was a way to prove they were a perfect match. No one understood she
better than him. No wonder he was the only one with her in the last time she
cried locked in the closet. There was no need to say something, he was just
there making sure she knew she was not alone.</p>

<p>Two open bags on the bedroom’s floor were the first symptom that something odd
was about to happen. He had not realized yet, but while he was getting ready
for another ordinary day she was on the telephone settling the last details of
her trip. As soon as he came in the bedroom the bags on the floor and the
clothes laying on the bed brought him memories of not so happy days.</p>

<p>He was still haunted by the time she moved to another country and the sad and
slow days of loneliness. The memories of the uncomfortable airplane travel
made his stomach sick and he vomited. Covertly, of course. He did not want to
show the jitters and he was still holding tight to the hope that, this time,
they would go together… they did not.</p>

<p>The following days were long and atypical. Surely it was still the same house
but it was not the same smell. There was still there the same coffee and the
same sunlight, but without her, it all was meaningless. He tried everything he
could to change his routine and get away of those painful memories. He tried
dating different people, eating new cuisine styles, different ways to go to
the same places but the result of it all was several visits to the doctor
trying to explain that the bad symptoms he had were coming from that part of
us that no medicine can fix.</p>

<p>That day began like many others after the fateful departure. He woke up before
the sunrise, woke sleepy through the house, tried to eat something and after
unsuccessfully trying again to fill that empty space in his heart he went back
to his bed.</p>

<p>The short corridor between the living room and the bedroom looked ten times
longer now, and each step was full of bitter memories, after all, that bedroom
that for many nights was theirs now was only his.</p>

<p>But not today. Today would not be a lonely day! His heart almost exploded when
he got it. Thanks to his amazing hearing he could feel something different was
happening. The step step step coming from the hallway was unmistakable. In one
big jump, he took off his four paws off the ground and on an almost
inexplicable speed flew to the front door of the house. That smell… he had no
questions about it… After 3 long months, they would be together again!</p>
