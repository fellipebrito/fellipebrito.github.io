        <p>Most of the times I don’t know how to pray.</p>

<p>How would a mere man like me choose the right words to address the Creator of
the Universe?</p>

<p>Despite my limitation to do so, the Christian #FAITH is that, in knowing that
we could never build ourselves to His level, God himself chose to be like us.</p>

<p>For thousands of years, The Torah and the Prophets spoke about the day it
would happen. The Day when YWHW would break out the limits of the Tabernacle
and fill the earth as water fills the ocean.</p>

<p>John believed that Jesus was God moving at our pace so we could walk with Him
and see Him face to face.</p>

<p>John, a Jew poet, would use all the beauty of the ancient Hebrew culture
blended with Greek reason to say that “The Word became flesh and made his
dwelling among us, and we have seen his glory”;</p>

<p>Today, he could say: “God became flesh and blood, and moved into the
neighborhood. We saw His glory with our own eyes.”</p>

<p>Jesus’ core message is that the Glory seen by John and his contemporaneous was
just a glimpse of the future when Heaven and Earth would finally be one again.
Thus, he taught us to pray: for “The Kingdom to Come”</p>

<p>I find myself going back to the Lord’s prayer every other day. I pray it
slowly; I breathe each of those sentences; I cry out my heart and my despair,
calm in the morning or intense at night. And then, sometimes, when I am
fortunate, it happens…</p>

<p>For a flash of time, without my outlining, with no model or plan, I can taste
it. He listens to me, and if I may dare… He answers me back.</p>

<p>I can’t describe it. It goes way beyond my comprehension and my reasoning.
There is no other experience like that, and I can’t share that with you, even
if I used all my vocabulary.</p>

<p>In times like that music saves me. Through music, I may join the prayer of
someone else so we can pray together; Music communicates feelings; Music makes
it possible for me to pray in movement.</p>

<p>Today I prayed this song; I wept this song; I danced this song; I bowed down
during the song; I found the words and the rhythm to explain the lament of my
heart.</p>

<p>If you, like me, can’t find the right words to pray or find yourself unworthy
of addressing the Almighty, close your eyes and join me and all those that for
two thousand years have been praying for his Kingdom to Come.</p>

<p>And if you want to sing it, you may read John’s words, be amazed about
everything he saw and testified to us, then, turn your radio on and sing:</p>

<p>I’m trying to hold my breath<br />
Let it stay this way<br />
Can’t let this moment end<br />
You set off a dream with me<br />
Getting louder now<br />
Can you hear it echoing?</p>

<p>Take my hand<br />
Will you share this with me?</p>

<p>‘Cause darling without you<br />
All the shine of a thousand spotlights<br />
All the stars we steal from the night sky<br />
Will never be enough</p>

<p>Towers of gold are still too little<br />
These hands could hold the world but it’ll<br />
Never be enough<br />
For me</p>
