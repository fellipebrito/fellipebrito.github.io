      <p>Since I was a teenager the development, creativity and improvisation were in my blood. Like every self-taught, I’ve started playing acoustic guitars and piano as well writing software by myself.</p>

<p>I’ve started writing software with Visual Basic and Delphi! Wow, I still remember the big Delphi’s bible I had to read to get good at it. I’ve spent a good amount of nights reading and coding. That was showing me how my future would be. My spare time is still full of tech books and late hours writing code.</p>

<p>Delphi gave me the first opportunity to make money writing code.</p>

<p>My next step was web-development, hard coded HTML, using Windows Notepad (By this time, I’ve not met VIM, the love of my life yet).</p>

<p>In my first real job, my boss gave me a slow Desktop with Linux and VIM as the primary editor. Telling you the truth? I loved it! I still love the time I spend in the black and green screen.</p>

<p>Fast forwarding, I’ve been the owner of my own software development company in Brazil for several years. I’ve interviewed, hired and mentored one great team of developers in Curitiba/Brazil. We call ourselves Devlandia :: the Land of the happiest developers on earth.</p>

<p>I’ve been responsible for the company as a whole. Taking care of client relationship, using Scrum/Agile to manage our workflow as well being the creator and preacher of our Code Review Culture.</p>

<p>As an architect, I’ve designed the entire infrastructure of several startups in Brazil and USA. Some of those accomplished their biggest dream - to be sold.</p>

<p>One of those sells brought me to the USA, where I’ve lived for the last years with my wife and our lovely dog.</p>

<p>Even being in love with being a mentor, manager and involved in the process of transforming ideas into products, I think I’m young enough to be playing with the boys in the field. Thus, I’ve not stopped writing code for the last 25 years.</p>
