    "post_content_markdown": "It is 825pm in Hollywood, the temperature might be close to the 90’s, and this\nlight in my face does not help me to cool down. I’m focused on a Lead\nPiano+Synth that I created for this new arrangement of an old song. If I just\nopened my eyes, I would see that the environment is ready for one of the best\nnights these people have ever seen, but I can’t open my eyes.\n\nDeep inside of me is happening a huge storm, and to be fair, my inner prayer\nis that we can get through this last chorus as soon as possible so I can go\nback to my shack and hide in shame and guilt for the next few weeks… “Here we\ngo, last two bars and I am done”… but that was not exactly what God had in\nmind for me.\n\n_Is it not interesting how much we pray for something to change without\nrealizing that the subject of our prayers could be exactly what God wants to\nuse to teach us something?_\n\nI was Music Director in small and big churches from my 14 to 21 years. We’ve\nplayed every music style you may think, from small gatherings of 30 people to\nbig gatherings of 7 thousand people. I could play keys, piano, guitars and\neven bass sometimes. And then, life happened. I had to move to another city,\nand then move again. I started my own company, sold all my gears and never\nplayed live again. Until, last year.\n\nLast year I was invited to serve as the keyboard player in my church. This\nchurch is led by an amazing pastor, a man that inspires us all to get closer\nto Jesus. Their worship team is getting more and more on the spotlight, with\nbeautiful lyrics that talk about the Kingdom, their songs are being played all\nacross the universe (pun intended). And their message is as close as it can be\nof the Heaven and Earth reuniting. There is a lot of bible and Christ there.\n\nNow, don’t take me wrong when I say I’ve been away from the stage for 12+\nyears. The Stage and Christ are not the same things for me. One is everything\nI am, the other is one of the many places where I serve. The stage is not\nwhere my Christian life happens. I’ve been a Christian since I was a little\nkid, and it has never changed. A church stage is an extension of my personal\nChristian life, not what my life is. I have to perform everyday as husband,\nemployee, boss, entrepreneur, friend, son… that is where the real spotlight\nis.\n\nSo here I am, a 30+ years old Nerd, with my musician talents rusted, with no\nprevious knowledge about this “synth” world, invited to be part of this\nmovement of Jesus that is happening in Hollywood. Everything is new: Click?\nNever heard of that. MainStage? Mainwhat!? Tracks? Dude, where I come from the\nworship leader would say “Let’s do it again”, and that would be our “cue” :P\n\nEverything has been a challenge since then. I’ve never before heard the “name”\nof the keys in English. F Sharp. I had never played using numbers. “Let’s go\nto the one, five, six four”… So, in real time I had to translate that from\nEnglish to Portuguese, and then translate it from Numbers to Chords… That is a\nlot of translation to be made in such a short amount of time. I could not make\nit if the team had not been so friendly. Everyone has helped me and embraced\nme as part of their team. Most of the folks have been doing music for life for\na very long time, and I was welcomed as a fellow musician. I thankful for\nthat. But their friendship and my thankfulness do not make me a perfect\nmusician right off the bat. So, I make mistakes.\n\nNow, as a Nerd and Software Engineer, mistakes are not something that I deal\nwell with. I can accept other peoples mistake very easily, we can even laugh\ntogether, but when I do something wrong, it hits hard. So, when I am playing\nmain keys, and then I lose track of the beat, or I struggle to memorize new\nsongs, it makes me feeling crap, so now, we can move back to that night in\nHollywood.\n\nIt is 815pm and we’ve just finished an amazing song. I can feel that the\nenvironment is ready for what is coming, and I know the setlist - I know it\nwill be one bomb after another! I’m excited! Sweating, and ready. I have\nplayed this next song 500 times this week, and it all starts with the Piano.\nSo, let me make sure I look at my synth, that I have the right patch selected.\nWe finish in F and then I need to go to D sharp and hold still until the click\nstarts - deep breath - The MD says to us all “make noise” - we just finished\nthe song, I hold the F - “keep making noise”, he says again, so I “open” the\npad in order to make it brighter, and I think “I need to remember to make it\ndarker before the beginning of the next song or it will sound bad” - while I\nam thinking it, the click for the next song started. I was so involved in the\nenvironment, that I did not see it starting. I just heard the “3 and 4” coming\nfrom the track and I rushed! I start it BEFORE the track!\n\nNow here we are, a new song, with important lyrics, hundreds of people ready\nto listen to something that can shake their life and I ruined it all! The lead\nvocal starts singing, and I know we are off the track. I am not exactly sure\nwhat to play, hands shaking, “do I play more Piano or should I open the pad\nand let it “hold” the environment?” - And in the midst of that, it is me and\nthe vocal, and I am doing it all wrong. Poor Lead Vocal has to take it all\nalone. (I’ve already rewatched the recording, and it was not close to that\nbad, but in my mind, in real time, it was completely horrible and everyone had\njust left the building because they could not handle Jesus’ message to be\ndelivered by such a crappy pianist).\n\nWe survive the song, we play the next one, but I am feeling an impostor. That\nis it. Now everyone knows I am terrible, I always knew it would come to light\nhow bad I am. And I destroyed a Sunday service - Guilty!\n\nIt was 825pm in Hollywood, the temperature might be close to the 90’s, and\nthis light in my face is not helping me to cool down. Deep inside of me is\nhappening a huge storm, and to be fair, my inner prayer is that we can get\nthrough this last chorus as soon as possible so I can go back to my shack and\nhide in shame and guilt for the next few weeks… “Here we go, last two bars and\nI am done”… but that was not exactly what God had in mind for me… before the\nend of the song the MD tells me - “Fellipe, we need you to stay playing -\nthrough - the - whole - message” - The pastor wants your help to “build the\nenvironment”. So, just feel it, and play some nice progressions based on the\nfeeling.\n\nFeeling?! My Feeling is a tense minor chord, I can just play it and hold for\nhours. =(\n\nAnd this is not even the biggest of the storms that are happening in my life.\nThat same afternoon me and my wife had to face an incredible challenge.\nSomething that has been around us for years. Usually, when I am in a place\nwhere I have no words, I go to my room and I cry out through my piano. So that\nis what I did that afternoon, again and again. I spent 30 minutes quiet, but\nmy soul was crying through my hands “Jesus! Jesus! You make the Darkness\nTremble - Jesus! Jesus! You silence fear”.\n\nThat is what I was doing. As soon as the pastor started the message, I started\nplaying the chords of Tremble. Very slow, holding on the verses… and then he\nstarts saying: “I’d talk about my book today, but I believe God has something\ndifferent. Let’s talk about David and Goliath. Let’s talk about I am a son of\nGod, and I can face all my giants. Let’s talk about going to the battle even\nif you are not the fittest or the biggest one. Let’s talk about using some\nstones to kill a giant while all the people who have swords are hiding.\n\nThat is when I take out my glasses, my tears were making it hard to see the\npiano. I don’t know what is happening anymore. The dude is preaching my\nprayer, and every time he says “God will destroy your giants, he will destroy\nyour fears”, I sincerely feel and believe on it, and my hands go to the high\noctaves of the piano to play “Jesus! Jesus! You silence fear”, people get on\ntheir feet, everyone is clapping, shouting to God, I am crying, we completely\nlost control of what is happening. I don’t even know where I am. I am sure I\nam not able of doing what I am doing, but we are in the midst of a Pentecostal\nnight and trust me, I’ve never seen it happening here. This is out of this\nworld. I am happy, I am in peace, I am serving.\n\nGod can and will use whoever is willing and with an open heart, to serve him.\nWe know limits, he does not. When nothing to offer, we fall short, he created\nthe universe from nothing. I’m glad to be a part of this band of imperfect\nbrothers. Peter was not a communicator, David was not a warrior, Joseph was\nnot a leader, Moses, Jacob, the young Timothy, etc. the Bible is full of\nimperfect people being used by God to change the world.\n\nAt the end of the service, I had people telling me how great it was. A great\nWorship Leader from another church came to ask me how I built the environment,\nwhat was my gear, what I’d use to play and how great everything was sounding.\nThe fellows from my band told me that I killed it, That I was the MVP… Even\nthe pastor himself said I made it easier for him and made him sound even\nbetter and his message to go further.\n\nNow, deep down I knew that I could not take any of those compliments to\nmyself. It was him through me. Through my imperfections. Through my shame and\nmy failure. Through my limitations.\n\nAnd if I could do it, so can you. I was asking God to please let me go back\nhome because I was a shame, I was guilty of destroying everything he had\nplanned, but I did not know he had other plans.\n\n_Sometimes God will put a Goliath in your life, for you to find the David\nwithin you._\n\n"
