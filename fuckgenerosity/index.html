				<p>We live in a society where not giving a fuck is stimulated. Seriously, I’ve even seen a TED talk about it. There are many gurus out there saying that the secret for happiness is to learn how to not give a fuck.</p>

<p>Please, forgive my French, but be aware - there is a lot more coming in the next paragraphs.</p>

<p>First let’s step back and make something clear: To give a fuck means you care. If you give a fuck about something it means you will spend your emotion, energy and money on it.</p>

<p>Ok, clear? So let’s go.</p>

<p>You know, no one has unlimited fucks to give. Fucks are not like money, you can’t work, get a nice Silicon Valley job and suddenly you have millions of fucks to spend. No. Fuck budgets are different.</p>

<p>Everyday, in the morning, you wake up with just as much fucks as everyone else and you need to be wise on where to invest your fucks.</p>

<p>Everyone out there is telling us that the wisest thing to do is to save fucks for yourself. The trend is to step back and start not giving a fuck if you really don’t give a fuck.</p>

<p>Now, I understand that social life can press us into spending too many fucks on things that we should really not give a fuck. The brand of the clothes we wear, the car we drive and the tv shows we watch… and it is just the beginning. If you don’t control yourself, you will end up spending all your fucks on things that you should really not give a fuck about.</p>

<p>However, the opposite is as bad as that. If you turn into a fuck saver, and start saying fuck to everything, than you will turn into a selfish asshole. Do you know someone like that? The guy farts in the elevator, does not take the shoes out when visiting you at home, cuts the line at the DMV, never says I’m sorry… why should he/her be sorry if at the end he really does not give a fuck?</p>

<p>And here is where I would like to propose what I’ve trademarked as #fuckgenerosity.</p>

<p>I am not sure if you’ve realized it yet, but life is not only about you. There are other people in the world. The beauty of the human endeavor is the society. Everyday we share knowledge, enterprises and feelings with other people.</p>

<p>And yes, I’m pretty sure the media tries to focus on those that are having a better or at least more exciting life than us, but trust me, there are many other people out there with a life worst than yours.</p>

<p>Right now, while you are reading this text on your smartphone or pc, someone is suffering some type of violence. Just pick one.</p>

<p>A woman at the gym is being eaten alive by folks who think they have the right to mistreat her just because they are man.</p>

<p>A homossexual that just got “out of the closet” will have to face his first day at work now that “everyone knows”</p>

<p>A black boy will have to go again through another day being profiled and hearing his thoughts saying he “does not belong” in loop in his mind.</p>

<p>A unemployed dad that is again in front of Home Depo waiting for a one day job.</p>

<p>A single mom who has to manage a schedule of work and  parenthood.</p>

<p>And that is just the beginning. Try thinking about people in Siria, Christians in Africa or a honest Muslim in the U.K.</p>

<p>There is a lot happening in the world for us to save all the fucks we have for ourselves. And remember, fucks are not money. So we can’t relax and believe that some Bilk Gates will appear and give all the fucks the world need.</p>

<p>The world needs more volunteers. More nice people in the traffic. More money giving folks. More people who give their fucks away.</p>

<p>There are an enormous number of people in need of the fucks You keep saving for yourself.</p>

<p>And here I want to open a parenthesis and talk to my Christian folks. Are you sure the fucks you are giving are the fucks you should be giving?</p>

<p>The new clothes you bought for the Sunday gathering so you look better? Fuck it!</p>

<p>Showing the middle finger when driving and raising this same hand to “worship”. Fuck that.</p>

<p>Speaking bad things about your boss or your wife. using this shit mouth to share bad news and complain about everything but you “don’t curse”? Fuck You!</p>

<p>Getting ready for “being church” for you is “serving” on Sunday morning? Fuck that too. Fuck that all!</p>

<p>Yes, The Sunday gathering can play one role in the Christian life, but it is just one role.</p>

<p>The Christian faith and its scripture are rooted on a narrative. The two biggest leaders of our faith gave us clear commandments on keeping the memories of what happened so we remember who we are and where we are going.</p>

<p>Both Moses and Jesus left us instructions for us to share a meal and read scriptures. The pessach and the Lord’s Supper both have a very important role on our identity formation.</p>

<p>The goal of those home based gatherings are to create environments and communities that through habits begin reshaping what we care about. And we christians need to reshape our thinking more than never.</p>

<p>The world is in need of what Jesus came to announce, and if we really intend to be embassors of his Kingdom, we need to remember what this kingdom is about, everyday.</p>

<p>The scripture should not be something that we read only. It should not be like a piece of clay that we bring our ideas and use it so we fashion it according to our ideas. No! It should read me and I must find myself addressed by the scriptures. I am the clay that is being transformed into its form!</p>

<p>When was the last time you’ve read one of the gospels cover to cover in one sit? How about the Acts of the Apostles? The exodus? The Creation and fall narrative?</p>

<p>Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with us? Why we can watch 8 hours of Stranger Things but we can’t spend 90 minutes reading John himself telling us what happened when God was walking in this earth? Where did we get lost?</p>

<p>Let’s be fair, if you don’t read the entire gospels by yourself every once in a while, you are not following Jesus. You are doing the same mistakes the Jews did in the desert. You are building a God for you. They used gold and built a image so they could serve. You are cherry picking a bit of Jesus from your pastors sermon, another part from a book you’ve read and even some parts from that movie you like. This is not Jesus, this is a Frankenstein, and you are serving it!</p>

<p>Let’s do it. Put the volume of the music down, turn off the lights and the smoke, step out of the stage and open up the scriptures. Let’s remember who we are, where we came from and where we are going.</p>

<p>Let’s together reshape our worldview, our goals and our role in this world through the scriptures.</p>

<p>If we do it, our life will be different. Our decisions about food, money, health, feelings  and everything else will be different.</p>

<p>That is the end of my parenthesis and the conclusion is: does not matter who we are, or what our faith is. We gotta get our shit together, stop pretending we are followers of Christ and start acting with #fuckgenerosity.</p>
