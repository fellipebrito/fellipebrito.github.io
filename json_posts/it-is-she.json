After 3 long\nmonths, they would be together again.\n\nHe had not digested well the long time they had spent away from each other.\nThere was nothing suspicious on the day she departed. They followed the same\ndaily routine. The awakening coffee smell and the bright light coming from the\nstill half closed window were foretokening another sunny day. From the bed, he\nwas sure it would just be another lazy day together while waiting for the\nsluggish forty minutes of hair drying and its grating noise to come to an end.\n\nThey would have the entire house only for them, she would let the hours go\nwithout caring about changing her pajamas. He would absorb each loving gesture\nand the love coming from her eyes. He surely loved those lazy days and the\nroutine was a way to prove they were a perfect match. No one understood she\nbetter than him. No wonder he was the only one with her in the last time she\ncried locked in the closet. There was no need to say something, he was just\nthere making sure she knew she was not alone.\n\nTwo open bags on the bedroom’s floor were the first symptom that something odd\nwas about to happen. He had not realized yet, but while he was getting ready\nfor another ordinary day she was on the telephone settling the last details of\nher trip. As soon as he came in the bedroom the bags on the floor and the\nclothes laying on the bed brought him memories of not so happy days.\n\nHe was still haunted by the time she moved to another country and the sad and\nslow days of loneliness. The memories of the uncomfortable airplane travel\nmade his stomach sick and he vomited. Covertly, of course. He did not want to\nshow the jitters and he was still holding tight to the hope that, this time,\nthey would go together… they did not.\n\nThe following days were long and atypical. Surely it was still the same house\nbut it was not the same smell. There was still there the same coffee and the\nsame sunlight, but without her, it all was meaningless. He tried everything he\ncould to change his routine and get away of those painful memories. He tried\ndating different people, eating new cuisine styles, different ways to go to\nthe same places but the result of it all was several visits to the doctor\ntrying to explain that the bad symptoms he had were coming from that part of\nus that no medicine can fix.\n\nThat day began like many others after the fateful departure. He woke up before\nthe sunrise, woke sleepy through the house, tried to eat something and after\nunsuccessfully trying again to fill that empty space in his heart he went back\nto his bed.\n\nThe short corridor between the living room and the bedroom looked ten times\nlonger now, and each step was full of bitter memories, after all, that bedroom\nthat for many nights was theirs now was only his.\n\nBut not today. Today would not be a lonely day! His heart almost exploded when\nhe got it. Thanks to his amazing hearing he could feel something different was\nhappening. The step step step coming from the hallway was unmistakable. In one\nbig jump, he took off his four paws off the ground and on an almost\ninexplicable speed flew to the front door of the house. That smell… he had no\nquestions about it… After 3 long months, they would be together again!\n\n"
