    "post_content_markdown": "One of the most famous stories of the Gospels is when Jesus calms the storm.\n\n_“Late that day he said to them, “Let’s go across to the other side.” They\ntook him in the boat as he was. A huge storm came up. Waves poured into the\nboat, threatening to sink it. And Jesus was in the stern, head on a pillow,\nsleeping! They roused him, saying, “Teacher, is it nothing to you that we’re\ngoing down?”_\n\n_Awake now, he told the wind to pipe down and said to the sea, “Quiet! Settle\ndown!” The wind ran out of breath; the sea became smooth as glass. Jesus\nreprimanded the disciples: “ **Why are you such cowards? Don’t you have any\nfaith at all?** ”_\n\nAfter reading that I could not stop asking myself why did Jesus ask them:\n**Don’t you have any faith at all?**\n\nDid Jesus really expect that they would calm the storm themselves? Did he\nreally think that this bunch of fishers, that had never seen something as\nsupernatural as that, would simply think to themselves: _“You know what? Since\nit is being tough to navigate through this storm: Storm, quiet! Settle down!”_\n\nWhile meditating on this text earlier this week, I came to the conclusion that\nJesus never asked them to do something superhuman. I don’t think he was\nexpecting them to interfere the natural order of the storm, neither that they\nwould mix some faith with clairvoyance and transform their boat into a\nmotorboat so they could run faster to the shore.\n\nHe had spent months with them telling that they would make good things\ntogether, big things! They knew he was the Messiah and that their story\ntogether was not even close to an end yet. Given this scenario, I can\nunderstand his frustration when they just started screaming: _“Teacher, is it\nnothing to you that we’re going down”_\n\nHe expected them to **face the storm**. That they would keep using their years\nof sailing knowledge to stand up against the ocean. You know? Simple things\nlike getting a bucket and start moving water out of the boat, set the boat\nsail in the proper position, tie their bodies to the boat so they are not\nthrown away.\n\nMy takeaway from this text is that does not matter the size of the storm, your\nfaith in Him and his promises has to be bigger than your fear of death. And it\nis mystic, it is supernatural, it is against the odds, it is the unspeakable\ntrust in his faithfulness. As Paul wrote to the Phillipians: _“There has never\nbeen the slightest doubt in my mind that the God who started this great work\nin you would keep at it and bring it to a flourishing finish on the very day\nChrist Jesus appears.”_\n\nIf there is something for us to hold close to our heart is the wise words of a\ntalking fish:\n\n“When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do? Just keep swimming, just\nkeep swimming Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming What do we do? We swim!”\n\n"
