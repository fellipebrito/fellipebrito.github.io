The Day when YWHW would break out the limits of the Tabernacle\nand fill the earth as water fills the ocean.</p>\n<p>John believed that Jesus was God moving at our pace so we could walk with Him\nand see Him face to face.</p>\n<p>John, a Jew poet, would use all the beauty of the ancient Hebrew culture\nblended with Greek reason to say that “The Word became flesh and made his\ndwelling among us, and we have seen his glory”;</p>\n<p>Today, he could say: “God became flesh and blood, and moved into the\nneighborhood. We saw His glory with our own eyes.”</p>\n<p>Jesus’ core message is that the Glory seen by John and his contemporaneous was\njust a glimpse of the future when Heaven and Earth would finally be one again.\nThus, he taught us to pray: for “The Kingdom to Come”</p>\n<p>I find myself going back to the Lord’s prayer every other day. I pray it\nslowly; I breathe each of those sentences; I cry out my heart and my despair,\ncalm in the morning or intense at night.

        "content": "<p>First a Disclaimer: I love superhero movies. I like both Batman and Black\nPanther. And I celebrate the fact that Wonder Woman and Black Panther are\nblockbusters. Now, to my main point.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen again and again my Christian friends celebrating black panther and\ntelling everyone to go watch it because “our kids need to see it.” Look, I do\nunderstand that it is important for our culture to have black heroes, woman\nheroes, all sort of heroes. And trust me, I am Brazilian, we have no heroes.\nNo one talks about Brazil. Americans talk about Latin America, but they are\nonly talking about those who speak Spanish (by the way, we don’t speak Spanish\nin Brazil). Even the “Latinos,” they don’t remember Brazil is part of South\nAmerica. Trust me; I know how is it to be a teenager and have no hero to look\nup to. So I get the point that for a black kid it is crucial to see a hero\nthat is not white the same way it is essential for a girl to see Wonder Woman\nkicking some Nazi asses.</p>\n<p>My focus here is not that; it is this idea that to win, we must kill someone.\nI heard so many Christians saying Black Panther was a game-changer; white\nfolks saying they would be “proud to be black” after watching the movie… it\ncreated a big expectation for me. I thought I would see something different.\nIt is not. It is Captain America… but black. It is Batman but in Africa. Think\nwith me; there is no difference between Wakanda and USA. They have a civil war\nthe same way. They see different nations as enemies, the same way. They talk\nabout immigrants the same way. With the big difference that the Americans\nyearly give a chance to thousands of immigrants to have a better life (as they\ndid with me) and did something during WWII. While people from Wakanda just\nreceived no immigrants whatsoever and watched WWII from their comfortable\nhidden paradise.</p>\n<p>There is no “game-changing” action on Black Panther. The “hero” comes back at\nthe end and does what every other hero would do: He KILLS the bad guy. His\nvictory is through violence. The last ten minutes of the movie is just a big\ncivil war in Wakanda where you see no signs of repentance. It is just the law\nof the fittest; Its dog eats dog all over again. The same way we’ve always\nseen in Europe, Asia and in the Americas.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you, the more I read the Bible, the more I fill unfit in our\nculture. If the story of the bible is true, then we are not from this kingdom.\nWe belong to another kingdom, to another culture. The way we behave (or should\nbehave) is different. We are aliens. We are exiled people in a place that is\nnot ours. I am not saying I don’t like hamburgers, good movie and Monday Night\nFootball. What I am saying is that we ought to be different and to tell our\nkids a different story. Our hero dies at the end of the story. There is no\nuprising movement; There is no rebellion; There is no blood. There is no\nkilling our enemies.</p>\n<p>Let me suggest that if Jesus had fought in the garden of Gethsemane the night\nhe was arrested, his disciples would have stayed with him, fought with him,\nand even died with him. They were clearly willing to do this.</p>\n<p>What they were unwilling to do was to renounce violence and trust in God. Even\nthough Jesus had taught them the peaceable way of the kingdom of God, they\nwere so deeply ingrained in the violent ways of the devil that they simply\ncould not imagine a way that did not resort to the sword. So they all fled\nfrom Jesus.</p>\n<p>We are the same. Pay attention to that next time you go to the movies. We all\nwait for the comeback, for the time the hero will say “enough!” and he will\nget his gun and kill the bad guys. We are all for vengeance and blood. We are\nall for the weak gaining some power and defeating the strong through violence\nand death.</p>\n<p>Paul, in his letter to the Philippians, while in prison, when asked how he\nwould act to those who were taking advantage of him, his enemies, said:\n“Everything happening to me in this jail only serves to make Christ more\naccurately known, regardless of whether I live or die. They didn’t shut me up;\nthey gave me a pulpit! Alive, I’m Christ’s messenger; dead, I’m his bounty.\nLife versus even more life! I can’t lose.”</p>\n<p>The world has seen too many times humans using violence to bring peace. We’ve\nbeen trying, again and again, to put everything in place by killing the bad\nguys. We think that violence will end violence - that punches in the face will\nend bullies punching in our face - that guns will end gun violence. It is time\nto say: ENOUGH!</p>\n<p>This is the Kingdom we are from, the Kingdom of God. That is why I don’t think\nwe should teach our kids to declare “Wakanda Forever.” We need to start\ntelling ourselves and our kids another story. Let us not flee from Jesus - let\nus take our stand with the Prince of Peace.</p>\n<p>You may disagree with me, but how can I think anything different when this is\nwhat our King told us: “Here’s another old saying that deserves a second look:\n‘Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.’ Is that going to get us anywhere? Here’s what\nI propose: ‘Don’t hit back at all.’ If someone strikes you, stand there and\ntake it. If someone drags you into court and sues for the shirt off your back,\ngiftwrap your best coat and make a present of it. And if someone takes unfair\nadvantage of you, use the occasion to practice the servant life. No more tit-\nfor-tat stuff. Live generously.</p>\n<p>“You’re familiar with the old written law, ‘Love your friend,’ and its\nunwritten companion, ‘Hate your enemy.’ I’m challenging that. I’m telling you\nto love your enemies. Let them bring out the best in you, not the worst. When\nsomeone gives you a hard time, respond with the energies of prayer, for then\nyou are working out of your true selves, your God-created selves. This is what\nGod does. He gives his best—the sun to warm and the rain to nourish—to\neveryone, regardless: the good and bad, the nice and nasty. If all you do is\nlove the lovable, do you expect a bonus? Anybody can do that. If you simply\nsay hello to those who greet you, do you expect a medal? Any run-of-the-mill\nsinner does that.</p>\n<p>“In a word, what I’m saying is, Grow up. You’re kingdom subjects. Now live\nlike it. Live out your God-created identity. Live generously and graciously\ntoward others, the way God lives toward you.”</p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>A skeptical from the get-go</h3>\n<p>Thomas was one of Jesus's twelve disciples, and even if you have just a\nshallow knowledge of Christian literature, you probably know that Thomas was a\nskeptic who refused to believe without direct personal experience. This could\neasily be Thomas' nickname: The skeptic disciple.</p>\n<p>Even before the infamous day when Thomas doubted the reality of the\nresurrection, the accounts already make it clear that he was not a man who\naccepted any kind of explanation. Take for example this piece of an account of\na conversation between the disciples and Jesus.</p>\n<p>Jesus said: - <em>“Don’t let this rattle you. You trust God, don’t you? Trust me.\nThere is plenty of room for you in my Father’s home… I’m on my way to get your\nroom ready, I’ll come back and get you so you can live where I live. And you\nalready know the road I’m taking.”</em> - John 14</p>\n<p>Thomas said: <em>“Master, we have no idea where you’re going. How do you expect\nus to know the road?”</em> John 14</p>\n<p>Instead of taking blindly what Jesus was saying, he questions it. He makes it\nclear that either what Jesus said was not true, or at least, it didn't make\nsense to him. If you, like me, like to ask “Why?”, You will be grateful to\nThomas and his skeptical way of facing the world.</p>\n<p>Thomas was not in the same room with the disciples when Jesus first appeared\nto them after his death, so, when they told him what happened, of course his\nreply was: _ <strong>“Unless I see the nail holes in his hands, put my finger in the\nnail holes, and stick my hand in his side, I won’t believe it.”</strong> _ John 20</p>\n<p>It was not enough for him to just see the body of someone who looked like\nJesus. He wanted to touch the wounds! Quickly his critics scream: &quot;What a\nstubborn skeptic!&quot;</p>\n<p>But think about it, aren't you happy that at least one of them didn't accept\nthe rumors as truth without pausing to ponder the implication of what was\nbeing said? Someone who knew how to value proofs and evidence above mere\nsentimentality? Someone who knew that wounds like these could not be faked\nand, therefore, refused to accept anything less than to touch them?</p>\n<p>If you have trouble believing in the resurrection, you are in good company.\nThe resurrection story includes many people who doubted it too - Jesus's close\nfriends, his brothers, his Greek and Roman contemporaries and countless Jews.\nLet's look at some examples from the eyewitness accounts.</p>\n<p>According to Luke, the first time the disciples heard that Jesus had risen\n<em><strong>“the apostles didn’t believe a word of it, thought they were making it all\nup.”</strong></em> Luke 24</p>\n<p>That's exactly what you just read! Thomas was not the only one to doubt it.\nAll the disciples, hearing the report that Jesus rose from the dead, thought\nthat it was nonsense, that the women were making it up. Even Peter, who would\nlater become the leader of the Christian movement, did not believe at first:\n<em><strong>“… Peter jumped to his feet and ran to the tomb. He stooped to look in and\nsaw a few grave clothes, that’s all. He walked away puzzled, shaking his\nhead…”</strong></em> Luke 24</p>\n<p>His answer is like mine, skeptical. He runs off to see for himself because he\ndid not accept to believe what only others had seen, and when he sees it, the\nempty tomb, he walks away... puzzled... shaking his head!</p>\n<p>They all question the report. Their faith is tested. And it is just the\nbeginning of their doubts.</p>\n<p>Look for example, how Mary Magdalene, one of the closest followers of Jesus\nbehaves: <em><strong>“Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. As she wept, she knelt to\nlook into the tomb and saw two angels sitting there, dressed in white, one at\nthe head, the other at the foot of where Jesus’s body had been laid. They said\nto her, “Woman, why do you weep?” “They took my Master,” she said, “and I\ndon’t know where they put him… thinking that he was the gardener, said, “Sir,\nif you took him, tell me where you put him so I can care for him.”’.</strong></em> John\n20</p>\n<p>Mary's first thought is not that a miracle happened and Jesus was resurrected,\nbut that although the tomb was empty, the most logical explanation was that\nsomeone had stolen the body.</p>\n<p>The resurrection was as unlikely for Mary and the disciples at that time as it\nis unlikely for you today. Don't let your prejudice rate the people of that\ntime as primitive and naive just because you live in the post-Enlightenment\nera. Make no mistake, even if we do not take into account the science of the\ntime, there was neither a philosophical nor theological basis for a first\ncentury Jew to believe that anyone could be resurrected [1].</p>\n<p>According to Luke, some of the disciples did not believe it, even after seeing\nhim alive, in front of them! <em><strong>“…Jesus appeared to them and said, “Peace be\nwith you.” They thought they were seeing a ghost and were scared half to\ndeath. He continued with them, “Don’t be upset, and don’t let all these\ndoubting questions take over. Look at my hands; look at my feet—it’s really\nme. Touch me. Look me over from head to toe. A ghost doesn’t have muscle and\nbone like this.” As he said this, he showed them his hands and feet. They\nstill couldn’t believe what they were seeing.”</strong></em> Luke 24</p>\n<p>At no time does the compiler of these events, be it Luke, Mark or John, try to\nforce you to accept everything they are talking about without reasoning or\nquestioning. They are the first to make it clear that, according to the\nreports of the eyewitnesses, most of them had some trouble in accepting what\nhappened in the days after the crucifixion.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Every story, like all knowledge, depends on testimonies of eyewitnesses.</h3>\n<p>Historically speaking, eyewitnesses testimonies are one of the best way to\naccess historical events. The gospels, in turn, are a collection of\neyewitnesses testimonies. This is not to say that they are a testimony rather\nthan history. This means that the type of historiography they are is\ntestimony.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Trusting a testimony is not an irrational act of faith that leaves critical\nand rational thinking behind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For a moment, try to put yourself in Thomas's shoes. If you had spent the last\nthree years living with Jesus, if you could easily recognize his way of\nspeaking and walking, if you'd also be able to recognize his Galilean accent,\nif you had seen his miracles and witnessed his death. Then suddenly you start\nto hear from close friends, people that you trust, that Jesus came back from\ndeath - Wouldn't you also doubt it? Wouldn't you ask for proof? I would\ndefinitely do it.</p>\n<p>Now, put yourself in Jesus's shoes. You've spent all this time with Thomas,\nyou've invested everything you had on him, you prayed nonstop for him, you've\ntold him several times about the imminence of your death and resurrection and\nthen, when you come back, he doubts you. Even after the other ten disciples\nassured him that they saw you resurrected and that you sat and ate fish with\nthem. How would you behave? Would your patience be exhausted? I know myself; I\nknow what I would have done. I would have used Thomas as an example of what\nnot to do, I'd have scolded him and disappeared without using the door to get\nout.</p>\n<h3>God gave us a mind to think</h3>\n<p>That is not what Jesus does. On the contrary. Jesus makes room for the doubts\nof the disciples, and later he does the same for Thomas, as we can read on the\naccount of the eyewitnesses: <em><strong>“Don’t be upset, and don’t let all these\ndoubting questions take over. Look at my hands; look at my feet—it’s really\nme. Touch me. Look me over from head to toe. A ghost doesn’t have muscle and\nbone like this.” As he said this, he showed them his hands and feet.” – Luke\n24; and days later, when he met Thomas, he said: “Take your finger and examine\nmy hands. Take your hand and stick it in my side. Believe!”</strong></em> John 20</p>\n<p>Jesus's invitation was never for you to put aside your reasoning and take a\nblind leap of faith. No! He invites you to sit with him and touch him. The\nwritten accounts of the eyewitnesses do not use a fable language. They are not\nan epic tale. There is no attempt to narrate a Jesus who could fly, or who\ntook revenge killing all his enemies, or who had his body magically healed\nfrom all wounds. Neither they try to show us disciples who did not hesitate to\nbelieve the story. On the contrary, the accounts are simple - just a bare, raw\naccount of the facts.</p>\n<p>For those of us who are skeptical and have a hard time believing, Jesus is\nready to hear our questions. If you identify with Thomas. If you have doubts\nabout the resurrection, you are in good company. Jesus understands your doubts\nand he welcomes them.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Much more information is needed to corroborate my statement above.

After 3 long\nmonths, they would be together again.</p>\n<p>He had not digested well the long time they had spent away from each other.\nThere was nothing suspicious on the day she departed. They followed the same\ndaily routine. The awakening coffee smell and the bright light coming from the\nstill half closed window were foretokening another sunny day. From the bed, he\nwas sure it would just be another lazy day together while waiting for the\nsluggish forty minutes of hair drying and its grating noise to come to an end.</p>\n<p>They would have the entire house only for them, she would let the hours go\nwithout caring about changing her pajamas. He would absorb each loving gesture\nand the love coming from her eyes. He surely loved those lazy days and the\nroutine was a way to prove they were a perfect match. No one understood she\nbetter than him. No wonder he was the only one with her in the last time she\ncried locked in the closet. There was no need to say something, he was just\nthere making sure she knew she was not alone.</p>\n<p>Two open bags on the bedroom’s floor were the first symptom that something odd\nwas about to happen. He had not realized yet, but while he was getting ready\nfor another ordinary day she was on the telephone settling the last details of\nher trip. As soon as he came in the bedroom the bags on the floor and the\nclothes laying on the bed brought him memories of not so happy days.</p>\n<p>He was still haunted by the time she moved to another country and the sad and\nslow days of loneliness. The memories of the uncomfortable airplane travel\nmade his stomach sick and he vomited. Covertly, of course. He did not want to\nshow the jitters and he was still holding tight to the hope that, this time,\nthey would go together… they did not.</p>\n<p>The following days were long and atypical. Surely it was still the same house\nbut it was not the same smell. There was still there the same coffee and the\nsame sunlight, but without her, it all was meaningless. He tried everything he\ncould to change his routine and get away of those painful memories. He tried\ndating different people, eating new cuisine styles, different ways to go to\nthe same places but the result of it all was several visits to the doctor\ntrying to explain that the bad symptoms he had were coming from that part of\nus that no medicine can fix.</p>\n<p>That day began like many others after the fateful departure. He woke up before\nthe sunrise, woke sleepy through the house, tried to eat something and after\nunsuccessfully trying again to fill that empty space in his heart he went back\nto his bed.</p>\n<p>The short corridor between the living room and the bedroom looked ten times\nlonger now, and each step was full of bitter memories, after all, that bedroom\nthat for many nights was theirs now was only his.</p>\n<p>But not today. Today would not be a lonely day! His heart almost exploded when\nhe got it. Thanks to his amazing hearing he could feel something different was\nhappening. The step step step coming from the hallway was unmistakable. In one\nbig jump, he took off his four paws off the ground and on an almost\ninexplicable speed flew to the front door of the house. That smell… he had no\nquestions about it… After 3 long months, they would be together again!</p>\n",

A huge storm came up. Waves poured into the\nboat, threatening to sink it. And Jesus was in the stern, head on a pillow,\nsleeping! They roused him, saying, “Teacher, is it nothing to you that we’re\ngoing down?”</em></p>\n<p><em>Awake now, he told the wind to pipe down and said to the sea, “Quiet! Settle\ndown!” The wind ran out of breath; the sea became smooth as glass. Jesus\nreprimanded the disciples: “ <strong>Why are you such cowards? Don’t you have any\nfaith at all?</strong> ”</em></p>\n<p>After reading that I could not stop asking myself why did Jesus ask them:\n<strong>Don’t you have any faith at all?</strong></p>\n<p>Did Jesus really expect that they would calm the storm themselves? Did he\nreally think that this bunch of fishers, that had never seen something as\nsupernatural as that, would simply think to themselves: <em>“You know what? Since\nit is being tough to navigate through this storm: Storm, quiet! Settle down!”</em></p>\n<p>While meditating on this text earlier this week, I came to the conclusion that\nJesus never asked them to do something superhuman. I don’t think he was\nexpecting them to interfere the natural order of the storm, neither that they\nwould mix some faith with clairvoyance and transform their boat into a\nmotorboat so they could run faster to the shore.</p>\n<p>He had spent months with them telling that they would make good things\ntogether, big things! They knew he was the Messiah and that their story\ntogether was not even close to an end yet. Given this scenario, I can\nunderstand his frustration when they just started screaming: <em>“Teacher, is it\nnothing to you that we’re going down”</em></p>\n<p>He expected them to <strong>face the storm</strong>. That they would keep using their years\nof sailing knowledge to stand up against the ocean. You know? Simple things\nlike getting a bucket and start moving water out of the boat, set the boat\nsail in the proper position, tie their bodies to the boat so they are not\nthrown away.</p>\n<p>My takeaway from this text is that does not matter the size of the storm, your\nfaith in Him and his promises has to be bigger than your fear of death. And it\nis mystic, it is supernatural, it is against the odds, it is the unspeakable\ntrust in his faithfulness. As Paul wrote to the Phillipians: <em>“There has never\nbeen the slightest doubt in my mind that the God who started this great work\nin you would keep at it and bring it to a flourishing finish on the very day\nChrist Jesus appears.”</em></p>\n<p>If there is something for us to hold close to our heart is the wise words of a\ntalking fish:</p>\n<p>“When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do? Just keep swimming, just\nkeep swimming Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming What do we do? We swim!”</p>\n",

        "content": "<p>It is 825pm in Hollywood, the temperature might be close to the 90’s, and this\nlight in my face does not help me to cool down. I’m focused on a Lead\nPiano+Synth that I created for this new arrangement of an old song. If I just\nopened my eyes, I would see that the environment is ready for one of the best\nnights these people have ever seen, but I can’t open my eyes.</p>\n<p>Deep inside of me is happening a huge storm, and to be fair, my inner prayer\nis that we can get through this last chorus as soon as possible so I can go\nback to my shack and hide in shame and guilt for the next few weeks… “Here we\ngo, last two bars and I am done”… but that was not exactly what God had in\nmind for me.</p>\n<p><em>Is it not interesting how much we pray for something to change without\nrealizing that the subject of our prayers could be exactly what God wants to\nuse to teach us something?</em></p>\n<p>I was Music Director in small and big churches from my 14 to 21 years. We’ve\nplayed every music style you may think, from small gatherings of 30 people to\nbig gatherings of 7 thousand people. I could play keys, piano, guitars and\neven bass sometimes. And then, life happened. I had to move to another city,\nand then move again. I started my own company, sold all my gears and never\nplayed live again. Until, last year.</p>\n<p>Last year I was invited to serve as the keyboard player in my church. This\nchurch is led by an amazing pastor, a man that inspires us all to get closer\nto Jesus. Their worship team is getting more and more on the spotlight, with\nbeautiful lyrics that talk about the Kingdom, their songs are being played all\nacross the universe (pun intended). And their message is as close as it can be\nof the Heaven and Earth reuniting. There is a lot of bible and Christ there.</p>\n<p>Now, don’t take me wrong when I say I’ve been away from the stage for 12+\nyears. The Stage and Christ are not the same things for me. One is everything\nI am, the other is one of the many places where I serve. The stage is not\nwhere my Christian life happens. I’ve been a Christian since I was a little\nkid, and it has never changed. A church stage is an extension of my personal\nChristian life, not what my life is. I have to perform everyday as husband,\nemployee, boss, entrepreneur, friend, son… that is where the real spotlight\nis.</p>\n<p>So here I am, a 30+ years old Nerd, with my musician talents rusted, with no\nprevious knowledge about this “synth” world, invited to be part of this\nmovement of Jesus that is happening in Hollywood. Everything is new: Click?\nNever heard of that. MainStage? Mainwhat!? Tracks? Dude, where I come from the\nworship leader would say “Let’s do it again”, and that would be our “cue” :P</p>\n<p>Everything has been a challenge since then. I’ve never before heard the “name”\nof the keys in English. F Sharp. I had never played using numbers. “Let’s go\nto the one, five, six four”… So, in real time I had to translate that from\nEnglish to Portuguese, and then translate it from Numbers to Chords… That is a\nlot of translation to be made in such a short amount of time. I could not make\nit if the team had not been so friendly. Everyone has helped me and embraced\nme as part of their team. Most of the folks have been doing music for life for\na very long time, and I was welcomed as a fellow musician. I thankful for\nthat. But their friendship and my thankfulness do not make me a perfect\nmusician right off the bat. So, I make mistakes.</p>\n<p>Now, as a Nerd and Software Engineer, mistakes are not something that I deal\nwell with. I can accept other peoples mistake very easily, we can even laugh\ntogether, but when I do something wrong, it hits hard. So, when I am playing\nmain keys, and then I lose track of the beat, or I struggle to memorize new\nsongs, it makes me feeling crap, so now, we can move back to that night in\nHollywood.</p>\n<p>It is 815pm and we’ve just finished an amazing song. I can feel that the\nenvironment is ready for what is coming, and I know the setlist - I know it\nwill be one bomb after another! I’m excited! Sweating, and ready. I have\nplayed this next song 500 times this week, and it all starts with the Piano.\nSo, let me make sure I look at my synth, that I have the right patch selected.\nWe finish in F and then I need to go to D sharp and hold still until the click\nstarts - deep breath - The MD says to us all “make noise” - we just finished\nthe song, I hold the F - “keep making noise”, he says again, so I “open” the\npad in order to make it brighter, and I think “I need to remember to make it\ndarker before the beginning of the next song or it will sound bad” - while I\nam thinking it, the click for the next song started. I was so involved in the\nenvironment, that I did not see it starting. I just heard the “3 and 4” coming\nfrom the track and I rushed! I start it BEFORE the track!</p>\n<p>Now here we are, a new song, with important lyrics, hundreds of people ready\nto listen to something that can shake their life and I ruined it all! The lead\nvocal starts singing, and I know we are off the track. I am not exactly sure\nwhat to play, hands shaking, “do I play more Piano or should I open the pad\nand let it “hold” the environment?” - And in the midst of that, it is me and\nthe vocal, and I am doing it all wrong. Poor Lead Vocal has to take it all\nalone. (I’ve already rewatched the recording, and it was not close to that\nbad, but in my mind, in real time, it was completely horrible and everyone had\njust left the building because they could not handle Jesus’ message to be\ndelivered by such a crappy pianist).</p>\n<p>We survive the song, we play the next one, but I am feeling an impostor. That\nis it. Now everyone knows I am terrible, I always knew it would come to light\nhow bad I am. And I destroyed a Sunday service - Guilty!</p>\n<p>It was 825pm in Hollywood, the temperature might be close to the 90’s, and\nthis light in my face is not helping me to cool down. Deep inside of me is\nhappening a huge storm, and to be fair, my inner prayer is that we can get\nthrough this last chorus as soon as possible so I can go back to my shack and\nhide in shame and guilt for the next few weeks… “Here we go, last two bars and\nI am done”… but that was not exactly what God had in mind for me… before the\nend of the song the MD tells me - “Fellipe, we need you to stay playing -\nthrough - the - whole - message” - The pastor wants your help to “build the\nenvironment”. So, just feel it, and play some nice progressions based on the\nfeeling.</p>\n<p>Feeling?! My Feeling is a tense minor chord, I can just play it and hold for\nhours. =(</p>\n<p>And this is not even the biggest of the storms that are happening in my life.\nThat same afternoon me and my wife had to face an incredible challenge.\nSomething that has been around us for years. Usually, when I am in a place\nwhere I have no words, I go to my room and I cry out through my piano. So that\nis what I did that afternoon, again and again. I spent 30 minutes quiet, but\nmy soul was crying through my hands “Jesus! Jesus! You make the Darkness\nTremble - Jesus! Jesus! You silence fear”.</p>\n<p>That is what I was doing. As soon as the pastor started the message, I started\nplaying the chords of Tremble. Very slow, holding on the verses… and then he\nstarts saying: “I’d talk about my book today, but I believe God has something\ndifferent. Let’s talk about David and Goliath. Let’s talk about I am a son of\nGod, and I can face all my giants. Let’s talk about going to the battle even\nif you are not the fittest or the biggest one. Let’s talk about using some\nstones to kill a giant while all the people who have swords are hiding.</p>\n<p>That is when I take out my glasses, my tears were making it hard to see the\npiano. I don’t know what is happening anymore. The dude is preaching my\nprayer, and every time he says “God will destroy your giants, he will destroy\nyour fears”, I sincerely feel and believe on it, and my hands go to the high\noctaves of the piano to play “Jesus! Jesus! You silence fear”, people get on\ntheir feet, everyone is clapping, shouting to God, I am crying, we completely\nlost control of what is happening. I don’t even know where I am. I am sure I\nam not able of doing what I am doing, but we are in the midst of a Pentecostal\nnight and trust me, I’ve never seen it happening here. This is out of this\nworld. I am happy, I am in peace, I am serving.</p>\n<p>God can and will use whoever is willing and with an open heart, to serve him.\nWe know limits, he does not. When nothing to offer, we fall short, he created\nthe universe from nothing. I’m glad to be a part of this band of imperfect\nbrothers. Peter was not a communicator, David was not a warrior, Joseph was\nnot a leader, Moses, Jacob, the young Timothy, etc. the Bible is full of\nimperfect people being used by God to change the world.</p>\n<p>At the end of the service, I had people telling me how great it was. A great\nWorship Leader from another church came to ask me how I built the environment,\nwhat was my gear, what I’d use to play and how great everything was sounding.\nThe fellows from my band told me that I killed it, That I was the MVP… Even\nthe pastor himself said I made it easier for him and made him sound even\nbetter and his message to go further.</p>\n<p>Now, deep down I knew that I could not take any of those compliments to\nmyself. It was him through me. Through my imperfections. Through my shame and\nmy failure. Through my limitations.</p>\n<p>And if I could do it, so can you. I was asking God to please let me go back\nhome because I was a shame, I was guilty of destroying everything he had\nplanned, but I did not know he had other plans.</p>\n<p><em>Sometimes God will put a Goliath in your life, for you to find the David\nwithin you.</em></p>\n",

I remember this intense\nadrenaline running through my body, this almost supernatural force pushing me\nforward and this absolute certainty that together we could do the impossible.</p>\n<p>I remember how it is to feel the boldness that only the youngsters feel. I\ncan’t forget how amazed I was when we fell in love for the first time. I can’t\ncount how many nights we spent planning our future. Do you remember that? I\nused to write you serenades. I could sit down at my cheap guitar or my old\npiano and sing to you the most sincere songs. I would gather my friends and\noffer you the most beautiful concert you have ever had.</p>\n<p>I’ve trusted you. I’ve given myself to you not only once, but many times. Ive\nnever had this love for anyone other than you. It was pure, naive, deep,\npowerful. It was me, completely. Nothing else.</p>\n<p>I would fight for you. God forgive me, I still do that! I’ve seen your beauty,\nbut I’ve also seen that the deeper the love, the more painful the wound.</p>\n<p>Why have you done that to me?</p>\n<p>I would not say that you had trashed my love. You have trashed me!</p>\n<p>I was not simply betrayed by you: I was beaten, bullied, derided, embarrassed\nand forsaken.</p>\n<p>I never left you, you threw me out and closed the doors to me. Like a flea-\nbitten dog I was driven as far as possible and then left there, to be eaten\nalive by monsters while licking my own wounds.</p>\n<p>It would be easier if you had just said “no”. But you made it sure to destroy\neach one of my dreams, even the smallest one. You scoffed off my talents. You\nforced me into a path where neither of my talents could be used, so I would\nlose my fluency and feel unfit even for the simplest role.</p>\n<p>Worse than that, you’ve hurt not only me, but my family and all my friends.\nI’ve lost them all, I’m alone in a foreign country with no arms to hug because\nyou pushed me away from anything I ever loved.</p>\n<p>They say the worst pain is the one that hurts our soul. How do you protect\nyourself from that?</p>\n<p>You know I’ve always loved you. I’d given up everything just to be close to\nyou again, to rebuild our dreams, and it consumes me. I hate myself for loving\nyou.</p>\n<p>How could you find me here? Why don’t you just leave me alone? My open wounds\nwere finally turning into scars when you showed up again. And now, here I am\nagain. Surrounded by people who love you. Young people, like I was one day. It\nhurts me so bad to look into their eyes and see myself on them oh, how that\nhurts.</p>\n<p>For a few minutes, I can even forget that pain and smile again, but I know\nyou. You’ve done the same thing for so many people, why do we still love you?</p>\n<p>You have hurt those who love you. You’ve mistreated the ones who serve you.\nFor Gods sake, you have even killed the one who most loved You. Why am I still\nhere?</p>\n<p>Like a betrayed wife or a spanked child, it is just so hard to get close to\nyou again. When I was young, I could run 100 miles to meet you, but now it\nhurts me so bad to take mere 5 steps closer to you. No one can see my open\nwounds, but they hurt as much as they did on the day you made them.</p>\n<p>Ive got to be fair, too. I blame you for a lot of bad things, but I have to\nblame you for some of the most wonderful memories I have.</p>\n<p>We’ve been so happy for a while, do you remember? We made a life together, we\nhelped so many people. We had fun and danced in the rain. We had many nights\nof love and every time I look into the mirror I blame you for the wounds, but\nI also blame you for the muscles I have today. I’m stronger because of you.</p>\n<p>My body wants to run from you as far as I can, run from your pain, from your\nmemories, from the people who are close to you and remind me of who I used to\nbe, but my soul and my heart love you so deep that every time I try to take a\nstep away, I take 10 closer.</p>\n<p>It is more painful than anything I’ve ever felt. I hate you. I love you. I\ndon’t believe you and I don’t see my life without you. I would like to never\nsee you again, but I know that next Sunday I will be there giving my best to\nrebuild our life together, our dreams, our wonderful world. Not for the sake\nof us, but for the love we both have for Him.</p>\n<p>It is nice to see you, and I hate myself for falling in love again with you,\ndear church.</p>\n",

        "content": "<p>First of all, I do not intend to have the final answers. As Sir Isaac Newton\nonce said, <em>“if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of\ngiants.”</em></p>\n<p>This subject, as well as most of the arguments I have lately come to reason\nabout, have been well debated by many great philosophers and scientists of our\nage. I can recommend you dozens of books and videos with the debates.</p>\n<p>Let’s also keep in mind that I’m trying to avoid TLDR text here. So, I will\nnot go deep in the explanation of some of my conclusions. I am starting a\nPodcast this month called “Following the Evidences” where I plan to give more\ndetails for each step.</p>\n<p>I’ve been challenged by some friends about the veracity of two affirmations\nI’ve given this past month.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The question about the existence of God is crucial;</li>\n<li>Faith is a reasoned choice, not something mystical in which we have no role to play.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>First, let’s see if it does make any difference if God exists.</h3>\n<p>If there is no God:</p>\n<pre><code> - Every type of life we know will be extinct in death\n - There is no immortality\n - The universe will also face extinction\n</code></pre>\n<p>Therefore, life has not:</p>\n<pre><code> - Objective Meaning\n      - One’s life makes no difference to the outcome of the universe\n      - There is no framework within man’s life can seem to matter\n\n - Objective Value\n      - There is no moral accountability\n      - Moral choices are inconsequential\n      - Moral values are delusions ingrained into us by evolution and social experience\n\n - Objective Purpose\n      - Without immortality, our only destination is extinction in death\n      - Without God, there is no purpose for life\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, through this atheistic worldview, it is impossible to live consistently\nand happy</p>\n<pre><code> - If one live happily\n      - It is because one is inconsistently affirming some type of meaning, value and/or\n      purpose, despite the lack of objective foundations for it.\n\n - If one live consistently\n      - One will live unhappy since one’s life is meaningless, worthless and purposeless\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the only two options we have are pretty clear, the existence or not of a\nGod is one of the most important questions we can ever answer.</p>\n<h3>Second, We have got to start talking differently about “faith”.</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, we have let the secular world and antagonists like Bill Maher\ndefine the term for us. What they mean by “faith” is blind leaping. They think\nwe have simply disengaged our minds and leapt blindly into the religious\nabyss.</p>\n<p>The biblical view of saving Christian faith has never had anything to do with\nblind leaping. Jesus himself was fixed on the idea that we can know the truth-\nand, not just in some spiritual or mystical way. Rather, he taught that we can\nknow the truth about God, humans, and salvation objectively. That is the very\nbest forms of investigation, evidence, and careful reasoning.</p>\n<p>Since the life without meaning, value and purpose would be absurd (illogical,\ncontrary to reason, meaningless, irrational) I urge myself to look for answers\nto those questions.</p>\n<h3>What does science, cosmology, physics and philosophy have to tell me about</h3>\n<p>it?</p>\n<h3>Science</h3>\n<p>If we compare the whole history of the universe with a 24 hours clock. We\nwould have no changes for the first 19 hours. Then, in 2 minutes we have\nsomething huge happening, and we would have all the species we know today.\nAfter that, we would not see any macroevolution happening.</p>\n<h3>Cosmology</h3>\n<p>Our universe is expanding, and Cosmology says it is possible to contract the\nuniverse to its initial state. It means that the universe does have a\nbeginning indeed, and therefore, something has caused the universe to exist.</p>\n<p>It is reasonably accepted that this cause has to be immaterial and beyond\nspace and time.</p>\n<h3>Physics</h3>\n<p>Think about a rule in your hand; now you set a mark on this ruler. Now let’s\ngrow this rule: consider a rule as big as your house, as your state, as the\nentire earth… now think about a rule as big as the whole universe.</p>\n<p>If you move one inch the mark you’ve made in a ruler as big as the entire\nuniverse it would not be that big difference, right? Now, this is how precise\nthe gravity force is. If we move the gravity force as much as one inch\ncompared tho the whole universe, it would be impossible to exist life at all.</p>\n<p>Not only gravity is very well fine tuned but the nuclear force,\nelectromagnetic force, expansion rate of the universe, velocity of light,\ninitial uniformity of radiation, average distance between galaxies, polarity\nof the water molecule. Life would be impossible if any of those variables were\na tiny bit greater or smaller.</p>\n<p><em>“An honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only\nstate that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be\nalmost a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been\nsatisfied to get it going.”</em> –Francis Crick, biochemist and spiritual skeptic,\nshared the Nobel Prize for discovering the molecular structure of DNA</p>\n<h3>DNA</h3>\n<p>We have only to see a few letters of the alphabet spelling our name in the\nsand to recognize at once the work of an intelligent agent. Now Human DNA\ncontains more organized information than the Encyclopedia Britannica. If the\nfull text of the encyclopedia were to arrive in computer code from outer\nspace, most people would regard this as proof of the existence of\nextraterrestrial intelligence. But when seen in nature, it is explained as the\nworkings of random forces</p>\n<p>Those are just a few examples that point towards a Designer, a Creator. The\nvery old Jewish Scriptures says the creation is a empirical evidence of a\ncreator.</p>\n<p><strong>Therefore, my faith is indeed, the result of a rational process and a logic\ndecision.</strong></p>\n<h3>I also have some questions about what naturalists and atheists take for</h3>\n<p>granted.</p>\n<p>The theory of biological evolution is simply irrelevant to the truth of\nChristian Theism. Genesis 1 admits all matter of interpretations and is not by\nall means committed to six-day creationism.</p>\n<p>The doubts I have about biological evolution are not biblical, but scientific.\nThey are fantastically improbable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Is it rational to say that fine tuning is the result of random coincidences?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is it rational to say that life is the result of the coincidental arrangement of molecules?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is it rational to affirm that randomness produced the world we see around us?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Did neuro-chemical reactions produce wonders such as love, compassion, and sacrifice?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How does one chemical state in the brain lead to another chemical state that leads to another and it produces universal logic?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, the most logical conclusion is to believe that nothing produces\neverything; nonlife produces life; randomness produces fine-tuning; chaos\nproduces information; unconsciousness produces consciousness?</p>\n<p><em>“Evolution has no evidence of transitional fossils. It is reasonable, but\nwith no evidence”</em> - Stephen Jay Gould / Atheist American paleontologist,\nevolutionary biologist, and historian of science</p>\n<p>So how does something is reasonable but with no evidence? And why only some\nthings can be reasonable with no evidence?</p>\n<p>Darwin himself, in a humble quote, reasons that <em>“Geology does not reveal any\nchain, and perhaps it is the most obvious objection against my theory”</em></p>\n<p>Later on, he says that take for granted that a human eye is the result of\nnatural selection and evolution alone is absurd.</p>\n<p>The Human DNA has a lot of information on it. Now, you do not see information\nin any other place in nature. Nature can produce patterns, but whenever we see\ninformation—whether it’s n a book or a computer program—we know there’s\nintelligence behind it.</p>\n<p>And even if Darwin and his theory were completely right, he does not even try\nto answer the question of where life comes from. To take the examples of micro\nevolution and apply that as evidence of macro evolution is a huge leap.</p>\n<p>For Darwin’s theory works, he needs The Universe, Life, and Information. One\nmay say it came from a soup, but the questions still stand: Where did the\ningredients come from? Where is the recipe?</p>\n<p><em>“If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch you must first invent the\nuniverse”</em> - Carl Sagan</p>\n<p>Good science should follow the scientific facts where they lead, including an\nintelligent designer. What is not possible for a philosophical naturalist.</p>\n<p>Bacon, the father of empiricism, affirms that “God never wrought miracle, to\nconvince atheism, because his ordinary works convince it. It is true, that a\nlittle philosophy inclineth man’s mind to atheism; but depth in philosophy\nbringeth men’s minds about to religion.”</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I think it would be inconsistent to require more justification for Christian\nbelief than you do for your own, but that is frequently what happens. In\nfairness you must doubt your doubts.</p>\n<p>I agree with Timothy Keller’s thesis that if you come to recognize the beliefs\non which your doubts about Christianity are based, and if you seek as much\nproof for those beliefs as you seek from Christians for theirs - you will\ndiscover that your doubts are not as solid as they first appeared.</p>\n<p>I commend two processes to the readers of this post. I urge skeptics to\nwrestle with the unexamined “blind faith” on which skepticism is based, and to\nsee how hard it is to justify those beliefs to those who do not share them. I\nalso urge believers to wrestle with their personal and culture’s objections to\nthe faith. At the end of each process, even if you remain the skeptic or\nbeliever you have been, you will hold your own position with both greater\nclarity and greater humility. Then there will be an understanding, sympathy\nand respect for the other side the did not exist before.</p>\n<p>I myself have done that and found answers to all those questions and much\nmore.</p>\n<p>They are not only isolated answers; they are trustworthy arguments from any\nstandpoint. Scientific, Philosophical, Cosmological and Historical.</p>\n<p>Through those answers, I can construct a framework that gives me what is\nneeded for my life have meaning, value, and purpose and therefore not to be\nabsurd.</p>\n<p>“I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen, not because I\nsee it but because by it I see everything else” - C S Lewis</p>\n",

I\nreally got captured by this act of build an altar, but not by the altar or the\nsacrifice itself. What keeps me in love with this act is that years later,\nwhen they are going here or there in the promise land, they cross those\naltars, and they remember. Even centuries later, when the country is facing\nproblems, war, hunger… their descendants can still see those altars, and\nremember the promise, and then they can be filled with hope..</p>\n<p>Even God, when talking to Israel through some prophet, always started with: “\n<em>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. The God who\nbrought thee up out of the land of Egypt”</em>. When I read it, I can see God\ntrying to remember them that he was always with them, even in the bad times of\nEgypt, and he brought them to this point, and they are still together… We came\nhere moving together, we will keep moving together forward.</p>\n<p>Usually we have this bad habit of make our problems bigger and bigger till the\npoint where we can’t see anything else besides our own problem. This habit can\nturn us into sad people, with no hope, bad mood and giving up on life and\nchanges.</p>\n<p>I have a couple of friends that decided to have a leafless tree in their\nliving room. So everyday, they could stop, write in a small paper something\nthey are thank for and put on this tree (this picture you see in this post is\ntheir “leafull” tree. Me and my wife, we decided to write it down in a book,\nthat we hope to share with our son and grandsons someday.</p>\n<p>How about you? What can you do to remember things that give you hope? Enjoy\nyour victories, have fun, make them visible, and always remember those\nvictories.</p>\n<p>This spirit of “thanksgiving”, build altars and let God show us that he is\nwith us since the beginning will bring happiness to your soul and peace for\nyour mind.</p>\n<p>As well said in one of the Hymns I most like from my childhood:</p>\n<p>_Are you ever burdened with a load of care? Does the cross seem heavy you are\ncalled to bear<br />\n__When upon life’s billows you are tempest-tossed, When you are discouraged,\nthinking all is lost,<br />\n__So, amid the conflict whether great or small, Do not be discouraged, God is\nover all;<br />\n_<em>Count your many blessings, angels will attend and it will surprise you what\nthe Lord hath done.”</em></p>\n",

Everyone who I look up to was there. The best\ndevelopers, speakers and entrepreneurs… the brightest and most creative minds\nfrom my community were there to share their thoughts.</p>\n<p>I felt really small surrounded by so many good people. Of course, it was a\npersonal inspiration to get better, study more and to improve myself and my\nteam’s work quality.</p>\n<p>Putting aside all this tech stuff, something caught my attention. As I posted\nbefore here in my blog, I’m a statistics lover. Thus, when I saw that they had\na yearly survey used to measure different aspects of our community, I promptly\nfilled it and checked the last years results to verify. <a href=\"http://www.ruby-survey.com/stats\">Ruby\nStats</a>.</p>\n<p>A lot of tech data grabbed my attention, I talk about them every blue moon in\nmy other blog (the one I use to write about code\n<a href=\"http://code.fellipebrito.com/\">http://code.fellipebrito.com/</a>]). However, in this post I’d like to talk\nabout something else: <strong>“What are your religious beliefs?”</strong>. These numbers\nare shocking for a country that is considered a christian one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>back in 2012 we were <strong>19%</strong> monotheists, a decrease of **4% **since 2009.</li>\n<li>also in 2012 we were <strong>68%</strong> atheists or agnostics, an increase of **6% **since 2008.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This year, in a small event with approximately 40 tech professionals that\nsometimes share the same project I work on, I was the only one to answer the\n“spiritual status” as: <strong>I’m a believer</strong></p>\n<p>When I defined this situation as a\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/fellipeeduardo/status/459763556112535554\">“challenge”</a>, I\nreceived an amazing question from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/roy\">Roy</a> about what\nwould be “so challenging”. I have to admit that his question made this\nchallenge even bigger. I will try to explain myself in the next lines.</p>\n<p>What one can feel from most of conversations, blog articles and social media\nposts, is that it is a good “status” to be an atheist or agnostic. It is a\nsynonym of being smart. Paraphrasing what Descartes said, “ <em>I’m smart,\ntherefore I’m atheist”.</em></p>\n<p>I made an experiment, sending a text message to all my contact friends saying\n“God is not dead”, I picked two answers that I received to show my point:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If he’s not, he certainly doesn’t give a shit about Brazil;</li>\n<li>That’s not what Nietzsche said.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The countless evangelical churches affirmations and their catastrophic acts in\nthe last 50 years make this even worse. We can certainly affirm that a\nbeliever’s brain is smaller than Homer Simpson’s brain.</p>\n<p>Of course I forced a little bit in the above two sentences, but, mutatis\nmutandis, that’s exactly what we see “being thought out loud” in every social\nmedia thread.</p>\n<p>While I was shocked with the conference survey results, other folks celebrated\nit: “I love to see #atheism winning in the #ruby community :: #railsconf\n#NonFiction #Science #Facts”\n[<a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrishough/status/459767149918052352\">https://twitter.com/chrishough/status/459767149918052352</a>].</p>\n<p>I’m always trying to live my faith. I am almost sure 100% of my friends and\ncolleagues heard at least once about my faith. Often I share my faith details\nwith close friends. And I try to answer everyone whenever someone asks me why\ndo I believe.</p>\n<p>I really respect most of these folks. They are capable professionals and\nentrepreneurs. Excellent people from whom I can always learn something new,\nand it is always challenging to share with them why I believe in the crucified\ncarpenter, in the incarnate God, in the Genesis and in the final judgement.</p>\n<p>Not a few times I took notes from their logical questions and I found myself\nresearching the answers with people who are more experienced and smarter than\nme.</p>\n<p>I’m far away from requesting everyone to follow my religion. And I’m positive\nI don’t have the answer for every question ( <em>Maybe 42? #nerd</em> )</p>\n<p>However, living in a world with no faith and no post-life hope; In a fully of\nreasoning and fact-based community; In an environment where you can fix any\nissue with some logical cod;. In a country where suicide numbers get higher\nand higher; In a society where a neighbor is importante just in case he or she\ncan give you something back… I feel myself challenged to continue to be a\nbeliever and share it.</p>\n<p>So, answering Roy’s question: ”What’s the challenge you’re facing exactly? Do\nothers not take your code seriously?”</p>\n<p>It is easy to make sure other developers take my code seriously when my\nprojects are reporting both simplecov 100% code coverage and CodeClimate an A\ngrade.</p>\n<p>What is challenging here, is trying to offer something deeper than my logical\nexplanations when some friend needs hope rather than facts.</p>\n<p>It is challenging to be a living evidence from something that is everyday more\noutdated, a proof of “lack of intelligence” and considered to be a\n“superstition” .</p>\n<p>It is challenging to be a spicy seasoning in a world that prefers “3 minutes,\npre made recipes”.</p>\n<p><em>The challenge, as was brilliantly interpreted by Jodie Foster, in the movie\nwho adapted Carl Sagan’s book “Contact”, is to try to be quiet…</em></p>\n<p><em>“Because I can’t. I… had an experience… I can’t prove it, I can’t even\nexplain it, but everything that I know as a human being, everything that I am\ntells me that it was real! I was given something wonderful, something that\nchanged me forever… A vision… of the universe, that tells us, undeniably, how\ntiny, and insignificant and how… rare, and precious we all are! A vision that\ntells us that we belong to something that is greater then ourselves, that we\nare <em>not</em>, that none of us are alone! I wish… I… could share that… I wish,\nthat everyone, if only for one… moment, could feel… that awe, and humility,\nand hope. But… <strong>That continues to be my challenge</strong>.”</em></p>\n",
